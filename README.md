ImportExportTool
================

A small Java tool that uses the DOVICO API to import and export data


Forked from dovicoapi/ImportExportTool


Changes:
========
* the line breaks in CSV files are replaced by space, so that the file is actually usable behind first line with \n in description field :-)
